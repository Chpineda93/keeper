Kepper App v 1.0

A very humble note keeper application, created in react, css, nodejs and sqlite3 :)

Intructions:

1. Download/clone the repository 
2. Type again npm install to get the packages/dependencies for the frontend application
3. In command line go to the folder server (cd server)
4. When you are in, type npm install to get all the packages/dependencies for the API
5. Now type the commands npm run knex migrate:latest  and npm run knex seed:run for load the database 
6. Type nodemon or node sever.js to run the API
7. Go to keeper main folder (cd..)
8. And now type npm start to run the frontend
